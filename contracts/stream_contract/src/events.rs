//! # FlowFi On-Chain Event Contract — Schema v1
//!
//! ## Schema Version
//!
//! [`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`] = `1`. Bump this constant whenever a
//! **breaking** change is made to any event (see compatibility rules below).
//!
//! ## Compatibility Rules
//!
//! - Fields MAY be **added to the end** of an existing event struct in a new
//!   version without bumping the version number, provided the backend decoder
//!   treats unknown fields as optional.
//! - Fields MUST NOT be **renamed or removed** from an existing struct without
//!   a version bump. Renaming changes the `Map` key the Soroban host writes,
//!   which would silently break every indexer that reads the old key name.
//! - New event structs MAY be introduced at any version; they do not require a
//!   bump on their own.
//! - The numeric discriminant of an existing variant MUST NOT change.
//!
//! ## Topic Format
//!
//! Each event is published as `env.events().publish(topics, data)` where
//! `topics` is a tuple of Soroban `Symbol` values and `data` is the typed
//! `#[contracttype]` payload struct. The general shape is:
//!
//! ```text
//! topics: (symbol_name, optional_stream_id_u64)
//! data:   <EventStruct>
//! ```
//!
//! Stream-scoped events include the `stream_id` as a second topic element so
//! indexers can filter by stream without decoding the payload.
//! Protocol-scoped events (e.g. `initialized`, `fee_config_updated`) use a
//! single-symbol topic.
//!
//! ## Event Catalogue
//!

// ─── Wire Format ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each event below is emitted via `env.events().publish(topics, data)`.
// `data` is the `#[contracttype]` struct serialized as a Soroban `Map`, keyed
// by field name (not positional) — so `soroban-event-worker.ts`'s `decodeMap`
// reads fields by name and is order-independent. The one invariant the
// backend decoder DOES depend on is the **field name and scalar type** of
// every field listed here; renaming or retyping a field without updating the
// matching `decode*`/`handle*` pair in `soroban-event-worker.ts` will silently
// break event processing. See `backend/tests/events-wire-format.test.ts` for
// the pinned field/type table and `test_*_emits_event` tests in `test.rs` for
// the raw topic/data capture.
